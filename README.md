## React Portfolio

A simple React based portfolio to showcase some of my github highlights. Will make the contact form work next and then shift to a more mobile friendly design


<br>

* add Logo, relevant photos
* making the chat form work
* initially using Browser Router to mimic the feel of a multipage website, likely to change later to a single page design with component pop ups for contact
* contact form chat bubble
* integrate some more interactive elements, shift to pop up on scroll to take away from some of the jarring elements on load
