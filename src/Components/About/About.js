              Iâ€™m an adaptable web developer seeking a work that challenges me to remain nimble. 
              I like to see the big picture and breaking down problems into manageable solutions; 
              give me a big enough whiteboard and I can conquer the world.
              And there is nothing more satisfying than the rush that comes with rising to meet a challenge.
